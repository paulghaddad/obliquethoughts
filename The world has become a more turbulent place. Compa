The world has become a more turbulent place. Companies that have thrived for years are suddenly bankrupt. The world economy has gone through two busts in two decades. How does this affect each of us? Most people rely on employment with a company for their career. Companies large and small appear stable, but are inherently fragile. We entrust our careers to these institutions; is this wise?

The market is constantly changing. New companies displace long established ones in a matter of years. The US automakers are a prime example. Other companies are in industries that are ever-shifting. US banks lost more money in 2008 than they made profits since they started. Creative destruction is ever present. Jobs that are stable on the surface are in fact risky when you look closely. Furthermore, the skills demanded are always shifting, whether because of technological displacement from computers or lower cost labor from abroad. We all must realize that careers are inherently fragile. 

How do we prosper in an era of fragility? The comparison between entrepreneurs and large companies is illustrative. Entrepreneurs can quickly change their companies abilities and market position. If they don’t, they are out of business. Large companies have the ability to continue on for many years, even in a declining market. But this long term decline hides many defects, and suddenly, the company finds itself out of business or needing to lay off thousands. We all must learn from the mindset of an entrepreneur.

With the rise of unemployment, outsourcing and crowded career paths, we have to be in control of our career and cannot rely on our employers. Even when our job is seemingly secure, we must be on the lookout for other opportunities or learn the skills required in future. Adaptation is how to overcome fragility. Evolution has allowed life to prosper for over four billion years; similarly, we must always be adapting and never standing still. In other words, we must be in permanent beta. We must employ entrepreneurial strategies to our career: create flexible, iterative plans; build a network that will expose you to new opportunities; and when an opportunity presents itself, calculate the risk involved, and take it. The corporate world has moved on from comfortable big businesses of the 1950s employing legions of “Company Men”. It now rewards entrepreneurial companies that seek opportunities to create new frontiers.

In chapter 2, we move from today's economic and job realities to what can be done about it. There is much advice in this realm: do what you love; choose an in-demand job. Instead of choosing a job from one vantage point, we should look at a career than way an entrepreneur starts a business: find a niche where you will have a significant competitive advantage over others. 

What is a personal competitive advantage? Three factors: your assets, aspirations and the market reality. There are two sorts of assets, hard and soft. Hard assets are tangible and can be listed on a balance sheet: the amount of money in your bank account; your property; and your degrees. Soft assets are intangible. They are your abilities, character; ability to communicate; strengths; and personal brand. Soft assets are much more important to your competitive advantage than hard assets. When you state your soft assets, it should not be in terms of, "I have worked in this industry for X years". Instead, it should focus on what you can do because of them: "I can build an app in Rails that has the ability to scale and is focus on simple design and ease of use". Assets are not permanent. You have the ability to develop them, and ultimately, are responsible for investing in them so they do not wither.

Your aspirations and values comprise your passions and core values. They are what you enjoy doing and care about. Your competitive advantage must be in an area that you deeply care about and love to do. There is no sense in becoming a nurse simply because there is a large demand for them. If you have no passion for it, you will not only be good at it, there will be others with the passion and drive to be much better than you. Furthermore, you must do work that matches your core values. If you value integrity, it makes no sense to work for a firm that takes advantage of its clients. Pursuing work that you are deeply passionate about, and that adheres to your personal beliefs and values, will sustain you for the long term. A key question to ask yourself is the following. List the activites you believe you are passionate about. Now compare them to the activities you do on the weekend or in your spare time. If they don't match, they may not be your true passion.

The third factor of your competitive advantage is the reality of the market. You may find work that fit your assets and passions, but if no one wants to pay you, it won't form the basis of a career. Entrepreneurs must craete a product that customers pay for. Otherwise, it doesn't matter what they are good at or passionable about.

Combining these three factors forms your competitive advantage. This is a similar idea to Jim Collins's concept of 'Your Personal Hedgehog.' Collins posits that you'll achieve success if you find work that you can be the best at, are passionate about; and can make money from.
