    <h1>Yutaka Sone and the Changing Art World: Past, Present and Future </h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 20 January 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Yutaka Sone, a Japanese born artist practicing in the United States, tells the story of the ever changing art world in his <em>Sculpture</em> exhibition in London&rsquo;s David Zwirner Gallery, where his fine art and architectural background merge with his love of landscapes.  Three intricately hand-carved marble island cities occupy the ground floor: <em>Hong Kong Island</em> (1998), <em>Little Manhattan</em> (2007&ndash;2009) and <em>Venezia</em> (2013); <em>Tropical Composition/Canary Island Palm Tree #1</em> (2012), on the first floor, is the only non-marble piece in the exhibition.  Although Mr. Sone works across a range of media, including photography, drawing and painting, sculpture is his primary mode of production.  The island concept resonates personally and politically with the artist; he himself is from an island and dislikes national borders.  Indeed, Yutaka Sone&rsquo;s marble cities go beyond his fascination with landscape to convey a deeper message: art centers past, present and future.</p>

<p>The environment at David Zwirner Gallery emphasizes the precision and beauty radiating from Mr. Sone&rsquo;s marble islands, which are placed on wood wooden plinths. These features are emphasized by the tan wood floors, white walls and windows covered by sheer linen cloth, permitting natural light to enter.  With ample space to walk around the entirety of each piece, the shape of the islands, city structures, landscapes and seaports become familiar: topographies of Venice, Manhattan and Hong Kong.  Mr. Sone used a variety of resources during a twenty year period to construct these cities. <em>Hong Kong Island</em> relied on numerous trips to the island, maps and aerial photographs; <em>Little Manhattan</em> used Google Earth and helicopter rides; <em>Venezia</em> required several trips to the site and the aid of an internet application.  In addition to the detailed representations, Mr. Sone&rsquo;s own emotive response and subjective interpretation are depicted on the sides of each city: <em>Hong Kong Island&rsquo;s</em> are rigid; <em>Little Manhattan&rsquo;s</em> are smooth with clean lines; <em>Venezia&rsquo;s</em> are bulbous with roughly textured marble.  The objective truths and subjective perceptions culminate into an art world reality.</p>

<p><em>Hong Kong Island</em>, <em>Little Manhattan</em> and <em>Venezia</em> are exhibited together for the first time to examine the world&rsquo;s changing art centers, while also remembering the past.  Mr. Sone&rsquo;s marble medium and aerial representation are deliberate references to the Italian Renaissance.  These sculptures are reminiscent of Michelangelo&rsquo;s <em>David</em>: pristine, carved marble sculptures with impeccable detail.  Mr. Sone and his assistants accurately portray each city&rsquo;s features, including the winding canals, seaports and buildings.  Moreover, the aerial view of Venice, Manhattan and Hong Kong is a modern-day reference to ancient Venetian map making, which served a number of critical purposes such as navigation, expansion, decoration and self-promotion.  Although Mr. Sone&rsquo;s sculptures carry similar themes, his marble cities also have a sense of permanence in a changing world.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>The choice of cities and their presentation in the gallery are critical, and inspires the viewer to create a connecting narrative among the three works.  <em>Venezia</em> is the last of the three sculptures encountered on the ground floor, and is positioned in the middle of its own gallery&mdash;in a connecting room away from the other two marble sculptures.  The rationale for <em>Venezia&rsquo;s</em> isolation and separation is two-fold: it emphasizes that Venice is no longer the art capital it once was, yet implicitly asks viewers to admire and contemplate an ancient city that once had an insurmountable impact on the arts.  The bulbous and textured sides resemble lava built up over time, representative of its long and rich history: an artistically influential city and trade center.  Known as a city of color&mdash;<em>colorito</em>&mdash;during the Italian Renaissance, Venice boasts art greats such as Bellini and Titian who captured the many reflections, ranges and hues of color reflecting on the surrounding sea.  Given its locale, Venice became a trade center with access to pigments, artistic styles and techniques that influenced the arts in Italy and throughout Europe.  Indeed, Yutaka Sone implies a dialogue between past, present and future; he recognizes the world&rsquo;s artistic roots in order to communicate his opinion on the future of art.</p>

<p><em>Hong Kong Island</em> and <em>Little Manhattan</em>, which are located in a gallery adjacent to <em>Venezia</em>, recognize the shifting art world: an up and coming art center and the present one.  <em>Hong Kong Island</em> is on the left side of the gallery at a diagonal; <em>Little Manhattan</em> is on the right, parallel with the wall.  This diagonal presentation suggests that Hong Kong needs time to strengthen its position in the art word&mdash;a message reflected in its topography, including its rolling mountains and sprawling buildings, as well as its rough and rigid sides.  Conversely, <em>Little Manhattan&rsquo;s</em> refined sides and parallel position refer to America&rsquo;s established art economy, particularly in New York City, which emerged as a global art capital in the early twentieth century.  Mr. Sone represents the organized borough of Manhattan, with its famous grid and renowned skyscrapers&mdash;distinctions that allude to the power of this art capital.  Although New York has had a significant influence on the arts beginning in the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, times are changing; countries such as China are quickly catching up.  <em>Little Manhattan</em> may indeed be large and defined, but it is also the only sculpture in the exhibition with a qualifier in its title: little.  Although the title and features of <em>Little Manhattan</em> seem to represent a paradox, this is Mr. Sone&rsquo;s way to communicate the changes to come in the art world.</p>

</figure>

<p>Today&rsquo;s world is bombarded by technology, change and a desire for the here and now.  Mr. Sone uses the ancient marble medium to tacitly ask the fast-paced twenty-first century to slow down and reflect on the changing world, while also remembering its art historical roots.  Despite their captivating beauty, <em>Venezia</em>, <em>Little Manhattan</em> and <em>Hong Kong Island</em> go beyond splendor and perfection.  These marble sculptures combine topographic accuracies and subjective perceptions to demonstrate Yutaka Sone&rsquo;s overarching narrative of the ever changing art world: past, present and future.</p>

<cite>&ldquo;Sculpture&rdquo; is on show at David Zwirner Gallery, 24 Grafton St, London,
W1S 4EZ, until 25 January 2014.</cite>
