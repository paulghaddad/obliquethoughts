    <h1><a href="/art14-london-a-global-art-experience/" title="post.title">Art14 London - A Global Art Experience</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 04 March 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

     <p>Art14 London demonstrates the globalization of the art world.  The second annual edition of this art fair features modern and contemporary galleries from 40 countries at Olympia Grand Hall in London, England, and offers a refreshing approach to the art fair experience.  First, there are two sections devoted to emerging and new galleries: Emerge includes 16 galleries, all under seven years old, that focus on the concept of &lsquo;emerging;&rsquo; London First highlights galleries under five years old that have not previously participated in a London art fair.  Second, the large aisles provide ample space between galleries, allowing viewers to enjoy the sculptural pieces placed in the walkways throughout the fair&mdash;an appealing way of viewer engagement.</p>

<p>With artworks from over 700 artists around the world and an expert-led talk and discussion series, Art14 London offers a global art experience.  Weaving through the galleries is an education in itself.  The variety of media&mdash;painting, sculpture and photography&mdash;includes a range of subjects: politics, appropriation, perspective, history and tradition.  The talk and discussion series is an opportunity to hone in on art from a specific country, including Africa, China and Indonesia.  Art14 London is indeed an opportunity to see great art, and to have a better understanding of the global art world.</p>

<p>Of the 180 modern and contemporary galleries represented at Art14 London, four works stand out.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Serkan &Ouml;zkaya, based in New York City and Istanbul, Turkey, is a conceptual artist that often operates outside traditional art spaces, dealing with appropriation and reproduction.  His sculpture, <em>Baker&rsquo;s Apprentice</em> (2014), portrays a young girl in the process of falling while carrying seven precariously stacked open cartons of eggs.  Mr. &Ouml;zkaya freezes the action just before disaster strikes.  The suspended eggs hanging in front of the girl imply the next scene: the eggs go flying into the air when the girl falls.  The fear of failure is a quintessential characteristic in Mr. &Ouml;zkaya&rsquo;s artwork; as the piece suggests, failure is literally about to occur.  Indeed small failures, such as spilling eggs, happen everyday.  Although the fear of failure is one interpretation, others can include the different associations with eggs: reproduction, a reference to the history of art when egg tempera was used during the painting process and the fragility of eggs is a reminder of the ephemerality of life.

    <h1><a href="/the-power-of-a-portrait-pope-innocent-x/" title="post.title">The Power of a Portrait: Pope Innocent X</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 01 March 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

        <p>Yan Pei-Ming, an established Chinese artist living in France, says: &ldquo;Portrait is like a mirror, it reflects to us who we are, what we are.&rdquo;  Mr. Yan is recognized for his large-scale portraits of world leaders and cultural icons, including Pope John Paul II, President Barack Obama, Mao Zedong, Bruce Lee and Pablo Picasso.  Mr. Yan keeps with a similar motif in his second solo exhibition at Massimo De Carlo gallery in London, England, <em>Innocent</em>, which displays fifteen replications of the eminent painting, <em>Pope Innocent X</em>, by Diego Vel&aacute;zquez (circa 1649-1650).</p>    

    <p>The Spanish-born painter, Diego Vel&aacute;zquez, is admired as one of the greatest European artists.  He was not only a court painter for King Philip IV, but also the only painter in Rome at the time allowed to paint the Pope, which he accomplished during his second trip to Italy between 1649-1650.  His famous portrait, <em>Pope Innocent X</em>, exemplifies what Vel&aacute;zquez is most remembered for today: the ability to convey a sense of truth and realism.  The Pope&rsquo;s facial features are lifelike&mdash;the scowl in his eye, pursed lips and ruffled brow.  Furthermore, the beautiful red satin that cloaks the Pope demonstrates Vel&aacute;zquez&rsquo;s sensuous paint handling.  The personae of Pope Innocent X comes alive as he sits enthroned in his royal garments with an unyielding glare directed towards the viewer&mdash;a motif that Mr. Yan also uses in his iterations of the same subject.</p>

    <p>Of the three galleries depicting Yan Pei-Ming&rsquo;s portraits at Massimo De Carlo, the ground floor gallery is the most alluring.  Two huge portraits of Pope Innocent X flank the end walls, interspersed with smaller versions of the same.  The white walls crowned with dentil molding on the ceiling and the chandelier lighting adds to the ambiance.  The many grandiose images of the Pope, combined with the elegance of the gallery, underscore the entrance into a dignified space, fitting for a renowned pope and patron.  However, Mr. Yan seemingly transforms this elegance into a claustrophobic and tense atmosphere by repeatedly depicting the glare that Vel&aacute;zquez originally captured centuries ago.  The eyes of all eight representations of the Pope are directed towards the viewer, who is self-consciously drawn into a narrative with a changed role: from voyeur to subject.  The hierarchical relationship is repeatedly emphasized in each instance&mdash;a juxtaposition that addresses the issue of domination and the weakness of humanity.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="/img/built/pope_innocent_x_5_6.jpg" title="Pope Innocent X No. 6 and Pope Innocent X No. 5, 2013">
      <figcaption>Yan Pei-Ming, <em>Pope Innocent X No. 6</em>, 2013 (left) and <em>Pope Innocent X No. 5</em>, 2013 (right)</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The power dimension is just one of the possible unfolding narratives in this exhibition, another includes Mr. Yan's artistic process. Despite keeping the position of the Pope consistent throughout, the subtle differences demonstrates Mr. Yan&rsquo;s painterly process: the rapid brushstrokes of oil paint, various canvas dimensions and range of colors.  For example, each image portrays the Pope&rsquo;s hands in a different position&mdash;clasped; opened; pointing.  In this way, Mr. Yan&rsquo;s process is similar to Andy Warhol&rsquo;s, who used repetition in many of his works, including his images of commodities and celebrities.  In both cases, the repetition tacitly calls the viewer to examine the subtle nuances, which emphasizes the means of creation. </p>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 22 February 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

        <p>James Turrell&rsquo;s first solo exhibition at Pace Gallery in London, England, <em>James Turrell: Recent Works</em>, exemplifies the adage: &ldquo;The longer you look, the more you see.&rdquo;  Instead of objects, Mr. Turrell uses light and space to explore optics and perception.  This exhibition includes four installations that span two floors, featuring two works from his <em>Tall Glass</em> series and two unseen works from his <em>Wide Glass</em> series.  Mr. Turrell&rsquo;s use of technology, light and architecture offers a spellbinding phenomenological experience.</p>
    
    <p><em>James Turrell: Recent Works</em> is an escape from the fast-paced contemporary world.  Walking into the dimly lit gallery underscores entrance into a subliminal space.  The gallery lighting is critical: it creates a meditative atmosphere conducive for receiving the brilliant colors emanating from his work.  The juxtaposition of yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, among other colors may seem unusual in another context; the blending and metamorphosing of these shapes and colors is visually captivating, while also evoking notions of time and ephemerality.  His piece, <em>Pel&eacute;e</em> (2014), for example, changes from a motif of three floating white, pink and red shapes to a glow of solid white.  The perception of color is further enhanced by the viewer&rsquo;s spatial relation to the work: standing near, from afar or to the side.  Moving around the installation is inevitable; part of the excitement in a Turrell exhibition is uncovering how the pieces were made.  <em>Kermandec</em> (2014) and <em>Pel&eacute;e</em>, two pieces from the <em>Wide Glass</em> series, use LED lights and a curved aperture to create a mesmerizing optical experience.</p>

    <h1><a href="/yutaka-sone-and-the-changing-art-world/" title="post.title">Yutaka Sone and the Changing Art World: Past, Present and Future</a></h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 20 January 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

    <p>Yutaka Sone, a Japanese born artist practicing in the United States, tells the story of the ever changing art world in his <em>Sculpture</em> exhibition in London&rsquo;s David Zwirner Gallery, where his fine art and architectural background merge with his love of landscapes.  Three intricately hand-carved marble island cities occupy the ground floor: <em>Hong Kong Island</em> (1998), <em>Little Manhattan</em> (2007&ndash;2009) and <em>Venezia</em> (2013); <em>Tropical Composition/Canary Island Palm Tree #1</em> (2012), on the first floor, is the only non-marble piece in the exhibition.  Although Mr. Sone works across a range of media, including photography, drawing and painting, sculpture is his primary mode of production.  The island concept resonates personally and politically with the artist; he himself is from an island and dislikes national borders.  Indeed, Yutaka Sone&rsquo;s marble cities go beyond his fascination with landscape to convey a deeper message: art centers past, present and future.</p>

  <figcaption>Yutaka Sone, <em>Little Manhattan</em>, 2007&ndash;2009</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The environment at David Zwirner Gallery emphasizes the precision and beauty radiating from Mr. Sone&rsquo;s marble islands, which are placed on wood wooden plinths. These features are emphasized by the tan wood floors, white walls and windows covered by sheer linen cloth, permitting natural light to enter.  With ample space to walk around the entirety of each piece, the shape of the islands, city structures, landscapes and seaports become familiar: topographies of Venice, Manhattan and Hong Kong.  Mr. Sone used a variety of resources during a twenty year period to construct these cities. <em>Hong Kong Island</em> relied on numerous trips to the island, maps and aerial photographs; <em>Little Manhattan</em> used Google Earth and helicopter rides; <em>Venezia</em> required several trips to the site and the aid of an internet application.  In addition to the detailed representations, Mr. Sone&rsquo;s own emotive response and subjective interpretation are depicted on the sides of each city: <em>Hong Kong Island&rsquo;s</em> are rigid; <em>Little Manhattan&rsquo;s</em> are smooth with clean lines; <em>Venezia&rsquo;s</em> are bulbous with roughly textured marble.  The objective truths and subjective perceptions culminate into an art world reality.</p>

<p><em>Hong Kong Island</em>, <em>Little Manhattan</em> and <em>Venezia</em> are exhibited together for the first time to examine the world&rsquo;s changing art centers, while also remembering the past.  Mr. Sone&rsquo;s marble medium and aerial representation are deliberate references to the Italian Renaissance.  These sculptures are reminiscent of Michelangelo&rsquo;s <em>David</em>: pristine, carved marble sculptures with impeccable detail.  Mr. Sone and his assistants accurately portray each city&rsquo;s features, including the winding canals, seaports and buildings.  Moreover, the aerial view of Venice, Manhattan and Hong Kong is a modern-day reference to ancient Venetian map making, which served a number of critical purposes such as navigation, expansion, decoration and self-promotion.  Although Mr. Sone&rsquo;s sculptures carry similar themes, his marble cities also have a sense of permanence in a changing world.</p>
