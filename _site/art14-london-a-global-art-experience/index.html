    <h1>Art14 London - A Global Art Experience </h1>

    <h2><em><time datetime="2014-01-21">By Amy on 04 March 2014 in London</time></em></h2> 

     <p>Art14 London demonstrates the globalization of the art world.  The second annual edition of this art fair features modern and contemporary galleries from 40 countries at Olympia Grand Hall in London, England, and offers a refreshing approach to the art fair experience.  First, there are two sections devoted to emerging and new galleries: Emerge includes 16 galleries, all under seven years old, that focus on the concept of &lsquo;emerging;&rsquo; London First highlights galleries under five years old that have not previously participated in a London art fair.  Second, the large aisles provide ample space between galleries, allowing viewers to enjoy the sculptural pieces placed in the walkways throughout the fair&mdash;an appealing way of viewer engagement.</p>

<p>With artworks from over 700 artists around the world and an expert-led talk and discussion series, Art14 London offers a global art experience.  Weaving through the galleries is an education in itself.  The variety of media&mdash;painting, sculpture and photography&mdash;includes a range of subjects: politics, appropriation, perspective, history and tradition.  The talk and discussion series is an opportunity to hone in on art from a specific country, including Africa, China and Indonesia.  Art14 London is indeed an opportunity to see great art, and to have a better understanding of the global art world.</p>

<p>Of the 180 modern and contemporary galleries represented at Art14 London, four works stand out.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Serkan &Ouml;zkaya, based in New York City and Istanbul, Turkey, is a conceptual artist that often operates outside traditional art spaces, dealing with appropriation and reproduction.  His sculpture, <em>Baker&rsquo;s Apprentice</em> (2014), portrays a young girl in the process of falling while carrying seven precariously stacked open cartons of eggs.  Mr. &Ouml;zkaya freezes the action just before disaster strikes.  The suspended eggs hanging in front of the girl imply the next scene: the eggs go flying into the air when the girl falls.  The fear of failure is a quintessential characteristic in Mr. &Ouml;zkaya&rsquo;s artwork; as the piece suggests, failure is literally about to occur.  Indeed small failures, such as spilling eggs, happen everyday.  Although the fear of failure is one interpretation, others can include the different associations with eggs: reproduction, a reference to the history of art when egg tempera was used during the painting process and the fragility of eggs is a reminder of the ephemerality of life.

    <li>Japanese artist, Kenji Sugiyama, explores perceptual and spatial constructs in <em>Viewer Outside 2</em> (2013-2014).  Part of what he calls &ldquo;intimate museums,&rdquo; Mr. Sugiyama places a picture frame on a plinth at eye level&mdash;an invitation to step forward and see what is in the &lsquo;picture.&rsquo; What awaits is a perceptual experience that may generate a reaction: a miniaturized, and very detailed, museum gallery, complete with paintings, people, benches, painted walls and wood floors that appear to extend indefinitely.  And this is what causes the reaction: how can such a detailed representation continue to extend when there is nothing but a slanted mirror behind the frame?  The mirror is the answer with the play on perception.  The environment seen is built vertically into the plinth and is reflected by the mirror; therefore, the scene appears to extend horizontally.  Mr. Sugiyama&rsquo;s use of perception not only draws attention to space and how it is perceived, but offers new constructions of familiar experiences.  His artist statement explains:



    <blockquote>I made small museums and they may remind viewers of the memory of visiting museums before.  Their memory brings them back to how they have perceived or how they remembered the museum spaces.  I present these small-scale museums as my inner self to the spectators.  I hope to open up a door for the viewers by offering the experience of new perspectives.</blockquote>

    <li>El Anatsui is a highly acclaimed artist from Africa, famous for his metal wall-hangings.  As <em>Iris</em> (2012) demonstrates, his works are as thought-provoking as they are beautiful.  The patterns of found materials&mdash;bottle caps, printing plates, condensed milk tins&mdash;not only reflect Mr. Anatsui&rsquo;s own history, but also reveal a transformation.  These everyday items are given new life.  The large curtains of material are spectacular: light reflects off of the patterned metal, emphasizing the protrusions seen throughout&mdash;a sense of movement that keeps the eye active and the viewer engaged.  Although the materials, color and movement culminate into a captivating rhythm, the stories go far deeper.  According to Mr. Anatsui in an interview with October Gallery:

    <blockquote>The amazing thing about working with these metallic &lsquo;fabrics&rsquo; is that the poverty of the materials used in no way precludes the telling of rich and wonderful stories.</blockquote>

    <li>J&uuml;rgen Mayer-Hermann is a German artist and architect, whose works combine art, architecture and design in order to examine human interaction in space.  <em>chit.chat</em> (2007) is one of the many sculptural pieces at Art14 London that fills the large aisles between galleries.  The title underscores the purpose of this piece: to generate conversation.  The colors&mdash;pink, purple and white&mdash;are inviting, and the built-in book shelves and dispersed reading materials indicate a public space to sit, read and chat.  Given its intent, this sculpture is aptly placed: towards the back of the fair between a series of galleries, and provides an opportunity to sit, rest and debrief about the great artworks seen at the fair.
