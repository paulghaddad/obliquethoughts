  <p>Thank you for visiting my site!</p>  

  <p>John Lubbock Sr. once said: &ldquo;Art is unquestionably one of the purest and highest elements in human happiness.&rdquo;  For me, there is much truth to this statement.  I created this blog to share my life-long passion for the arts: my parents introduced me to the arts at a young age, and I studied art history in high school and college.  The arts have been a common thread throughout my life, which I repeatedly turned to until I decided to pursue this passion full-time.</p>

  <p>As a student at Denison University, I took art history classes and studied abroad in Florence, Italy.  Living and studying in this seminal art city had a lasting impact on me, even to this day: it changed the way I examine, appreciate and experience art.  Following graduation, I began a career in the pharmaceutical industry.  Yet, after five years, I realized my true passion lay with the arts, and decided to embark on my journey into the art world.</p>

  <p>To receive a solid foundation in art history, and in preparation for graduate school, I took graduate-level courses in art history at The Ohio State University for two years.  At the same time, I immersed myself in the field through research, internships and as a docent.  Although I took a range of courses at OSU, from the Renaissance to Contemporary, I gravitated towards Contemporary Art.  And indeed, this field brought me to my current endeavor: graduate school in Sotheby&rsquo;s Contemporary Art Masters Program in London.</p> 

  <p>This journey into the art world has been, and continues to be, insightful.  During this process, I have uncovered my desire to write about the arts.  I enjoy using the written word to share my experiences&mdash;and passion&mdash;with others.  There is much to share when living in an art capital with a plethora of galleries, museums, lectures and art fairs. My blog is an opportunity for me to review and think critically about all matters of the art world.  Keep abreast of the changing art world and my journey on this site!</p>
