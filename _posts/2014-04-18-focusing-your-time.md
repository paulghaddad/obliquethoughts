How do we become better at managing our time? Countless books and entire industries have tried to answer that question. I believe it all starts with knowing ourself. Some people work best in the morning; others in the wee hours of the night. Whatever it is, an understanding of your peak time of day is the first step. 

The second is having the discipline to block that window of time for your best work. It is far too easy to start checking your email or Twitter feed because you feel like it. But if this is your peak window, you are doing your lowest priority work when you are at your best. By focusing on your most important work in this window, you not only get more done, but you will do your best work. 

Much of the time management industry preaches doing as much work as you can fit in the day. But this is counterproductive; it assumes each hour is equal. I break up my day into tranches. One tranch is for my most productive work; this is normally in the morning to early afternoon. But once the middle of the afternoon comes around, I lose my focus and ability to do difficult tasks. Thus, I move on to less crucial work, such as responding to emails or paying the bills. Then I get another boost in the early evening. I make sure I get some productive work in during this tranch, because by the later evening, I know I must shift into more passive activities such as reading blog posts or watching tutorial videos.

Only if we have the understanding of our bodies&emdash;when we're at our peak&emdash;and combining that with the discipline to focus on our key activities during our peak hours, will we be able to do our best work.
