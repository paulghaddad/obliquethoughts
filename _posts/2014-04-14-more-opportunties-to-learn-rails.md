Life is busy right now. Amy and I have four months left in London, and there is much to do. It is amazing how fast time has gone. Before long, we'll be back in the United States doing who knows what. She is working hard on improving her writing skills and writing stories for her blog and Medium. I am continuing my pursuit of learning web application development. 

There are many facets to web applications. Learning Ruby better and building an app in Rails are my top priorities. As I continue building apps, I will be able to learn other technologies that are important, such as jQuery and Amazon Web Services. But for now, the priority is becoming better at Ruby, understanding good programming fundamentals and Object-Oriented design and building apps on my own. Everything else is ancilliary.

I did come across a couple of new things. There are two good MOOCs on learning Rails out right now. The first is on Coursera, and teaches Rails in conjuction with Web Application Architectures. I decided to stop my current work with the Pragmatic Studio course because it is a short course and teaches fundamental, underlying principles of Rails that will be useful in future. I also saw the UC Berkeley Rails course is once again offering a session starting later this week. It appears to be a rigorous course that makes you build your own app, while teaching Ruby and Agile methods. Coming from a distinguished University in Silicon Valley makes it that much more enticing. 

With two courses, one already started, and a second starting within a week, I will be busy. I'm almost halfway done with the first, so I am on target to finish it in time to get the second underway. Suffice to say, my writing will be limited to blog posts. I'll save longer form Medium posts once I finish the first course.
