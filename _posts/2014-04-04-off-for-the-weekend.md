I'll be packing my bags for a trip to the British mid-lands this weekend for the annual BAFRA football officiating conference. I always go to the Great Lakes clinic in April, but with me in London, this is out of the question. I am happy that I'll be able to continue regularly attending a clinic. What's better is that I'll be doing a lot of presenting. I start off the clinic with one of the keynotes on "Stepping Up", and then give four break-out session talks on DPI, OPI and Catch-No Catch. I enjoy presenting at officiating clinics and meetings; it allows me to hone my skills with a topic I am really passionate about.

On other fronts, this week I started a Rails app to help me organize my freelance customers. I am following the Pragmatic Studio's Rails 1 course. My goal is to really dig deep into Rails, and learn it the hard way: by building something on my own. I also hope to improve my jQuery and Javascript skills by addingx functionality in the app that calls for their use.

See you next week!
