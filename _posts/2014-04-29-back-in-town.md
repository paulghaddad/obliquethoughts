Amy and I are now back in town after a quick trip to Ireland. We loved everything about the country. It has great people, scenary and pubs. There is a very different vibe than here in the UK. People go out of there way to help you; they also seem to have an affection for Americans. Perhaps because of all the immigrants who came to our country. 

We focused our trip on Dublin, Killarney National Park and the Dingle Peninsula. The latter two were on the west coast of the country. The scenary was breathtaking; I thought I was in the Western US! Very large vistas with gorgoeous mountains punctuated our drive from Killarney (a very touristy town and one to avoid) to Kenmare. We stayed at a nice Bed and Breakfast just off a lake. It was quite relaxing. The town of Kenmare was very small, but much less touristy than Killarney with a better selection of restaurants. We chose No. 35, where we had a great meal. Amy's Irish stew was delicious, and we had two wonderful craft beers. 

We then explored the Dingle Pensisula. This area is very remote, and once you venture outside the small town of Dingle, an authentic feel. The peninsula has hills all around and a spectacular shoreline with dramatic cliffs. We hiked to the top of the tallest peak on the peninsula, followed by a long walk along the shore with great views of the cliffs. Back in Dingle Town, we enjoyed a nice meal at a seafood restaurant (which only had seafood!). This was followed by going to an Irish Pub and hearing music. It was quite a nice pub, and we enjoyed the music, but it was nothing like the pub in Dublin.

Our time in Dublin was highlighted by going to Brazen Head three times! While the food wasn't as good as the Brazenhead in Columbus, the atmosphere, beer and music was much better than expected. We enjoyed Irish stew and a burger for dinner, followed by wonderful live music. We could tell the Irish are really proud of their culture and welcoming of visitors.

We would both highly recommend Ireland. It is a great place to relax, enjoy good food and beer and be around great people.
