Writing is one of those tasks that sometimes comes easy, but is often hard. When I write for this blog, the words flow and easily come out. Yet, when I write a formal essay on Medium, I can't seem to write anything of substance. The words are hard to come by.

Why is that? Is it because there is no pressure when writing for a blog? Perhaps the best way to write, then, is to write blog posts, and when good ideas start flowing, to keep going until you've written an essay in the process. 

Amy and I attended a talk last night on writing in the art world. It was actually very helpful for all writing pursuits. So many ideas came out of it: pick a good writer and emulate him; write to learn; and do it because you want to. It made me want to go back to my notes on good writing principles to get better myself. The key takeaway from the session is to write because you have something to say. I am not sure I could write on deadlines. Not even David Heinemeier Hansson, one of my role models and whom I consider an excellent writer, could do this.

I take inspriration from Hansson's story. In my pursuit of learning Rails, I've been reading through his blog archives from over ten years ago. Not only does this provide a good foundation for learning the basis of Rails, it also lets me see the progression of a writer through time. David is a native Dane, and early in his blog, it is evident that English is not his first language. Verbs with improper tenses, misspellings and awkward idioms all line his early writing. But as I have been reading his posts, one thing is evident: improvement. Now he is a New York Times bestselling author!

I have been going through several ideas on how to improve my writing. Do I set a weekly goal to write a long essay on Medium? Do I go through a Great Course? I think the best way is to  have a blog to write for pleasure. When a good idea comes around, I can enhance the idea into a longer post for Medium. And throughout, try to emulate my favorite writers&emdash;Hansson; Jim Collins; and Adrian Wooldridge&emdash;and trust that I will improve with time.
