Why is writing so essential is today's world? I think there are two reasons. First, there has been a trend for anyone, journalist or not, to write for the world. Platforms such as Twitter, Medium and LinkedIn provide the opportunity for anyone in the world to speak. Second, it is a means to generate new thoughts and ideas. When brought up in school, we are taught to state and defend a thesis&mdash;the five-paragraph essay. Writing in this style is important for a lawyer or when trying to persuade, but it rests on a key assumption: you know your thesis before you write. Often we don't, and the act of writing provides us with new ideas.

I plan to advance these ideas in more detail in my weekly long essay. I have always found it difficult to write, and sometimes the reason is because I'm so worried about my thesis and evidence before writing that I don't even start typing. This blog provides me a platform to simply write. Write without being preoccupied by a thesis at the outset. Write to get better. And write to generate ideas to help in my life pursuits.
