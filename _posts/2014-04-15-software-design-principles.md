I am taking a keen interest in higher level thinking in software development. Concepts likes design patterns and object-oriented programming are fascinating. In continuing to go through DHH's old blog, it is amazing the inspiration he received by studying existing patterns and frameworks. Rails was designed from the beginning with several principles in mind: the MVC pattern to separate concerns; ActiveRecord to interact with the database; the 'Don't Repeat Yourself" principle; among many others. This is what separates Rails from most other frameworks. 

Take Wordpress. Although it is a prolific Content Management System used all across the web, its overall design is poor. It started as a blogging engine, and consists of template files that combine presentation code (HTML and CSS) with logic. Then it has a database setup that is very confusing. This is all reinforced by route logic that depends on rules that often don't work. Working with complex Wordpress sites has always frustrated me. As I learn more about Rails, I really appreciate the overall design principles it uses.

The MOOC from UNM I am currently going through does an excellent job of explaining these higher-level principles. I am excited to continue learning about software design.
